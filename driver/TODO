Add functions to set interrupt masks
Get rid of temporary static and/or global variables (move to tl880_dev, etc.)
Add ioctl interface for mode switch function and other functions
Use request_firmware() when the firmware is available and needed
Replace all ints/longs with appropriate u32/s32/u16/s16 etc. types (?)
Replace osdmem stuff with a proven public domain malloc algorithm
Use CHECK_NULL and CHECK_NULL_W more
Add read() function to tl880/mem? device to allow hexedit to work on TL880 memory
Figure out DPC PLL constant register.
Incorporate information from ivs.c (outside source tree).
Move to the DVB API.
Fix the proc interface (though it works, it "shouldn't").
Make sure that yGetTL850Memory is really allocating card memory (not system
  memory)
What if top half gets called multiple times before bottom half executes?  Make
  a new struct that contains information about each interrupt state, kmalloc it
  in top half, free it in bottom half.  If necessary.
Make the "someone else's interrupt" code more robust (it gives false alarms).
