Core driver:
 - Add functions to set interrupt masks
 - Get rid of temporary static and/or global variables (move to tl880_dev, etc.)
 - Add ioctl interface for mode switch function and other functions
 - Use request_firmware() when the firmware is available and needed
 - Use CHECK_NULL and CHECK_NULL_W more
 - Add read() function to tl880/mem? device to allow hexedit to work on TL880 memory
 - Figure out DPC PLL constant register.
 - Incorporate information from ivs.c (outside source tree).
 - Move to the DVB API.
 - Fix the proc interface (though it works, it "shouldn't").
 - What if top half gets called multiple times before bottom half executes?  Make
   a new struct that contains information about each interrupt state, kmalloc it
   in top half, free it in bottom half.  If necessary.
 - Make the "someone else's interrupt" code more robust (it gives false alarms).
 - Add a compat_ioctl to allow 32-bit programs to interface with the tl880.
 - Change tl880_clear_sdram to use length rather than end address.


ALSA driver:
 - Better integrate the core driver and the ALSA driver (including hotplugging).
 - Actually set the sample rate when the device is opened.
