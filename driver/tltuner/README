These files are from the bttv driver provided for use with the PCHDTV.  See
http://www.pchdtv.com/ for the latest version of their driver.  These files were
taken from the debian-1.1 tarball.

Modifications: change detection to look for TL880 I2C instead of bttv I2C,
change module description to reflect modifications.

Kernel module's name is tltuner.o (do not install tuner.o).
