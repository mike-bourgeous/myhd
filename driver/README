TL880 Kernel Module
2003, 2005-2007 Mike Bourgeous, et. al. (See AUTHORS file)

Original Framework (based on Stradis driver, mostly gone) in tl880kern.c
2003, Mark Lehrer

This kernel module only detects TL880-based cards and attaches to devices in
/dev to map their memory regions.  It also has a preliminary interrupt handler,
ioctl interface, as well as working I2C support for some cards.  It is written
with support for multiple cards in one system.

This module is only suitable for developers and testing.  It has no video
capture ability.  Only use this driver if you want to help with its development
or you want to help with testing.

The driver must be manually loaded as root by using insmod tl880.ko after it is
compiled.  Compilation is achieved with kbuild, so all standard features of
kbuild are available.  Use "make" to compile, "make clean" to clean, etc.  Use
the tl880_mkdev and tl880_rmdev scripts after loading the module to create and
remove character devices for each TL880 card in /dev/tl880/.

I2C support (tl880i2c.c) is complete.  There are several I2C interfaces
provided, which are selected by card revision.  This module will automatically
request the i2c-dev and i2c-algo-bit modules.  The MyHD has devices on all three
of its I2C buses.  Cards other than the MyHD, WinTV-HD, HiPix, and Janus will
probably use different GPIO lines for the I2C bus(es) than the possibilities
already handled in tl880i2c.c.  Once the correct port is known, the bus needs to
be registered with the bit shift algorithm driver, as is done in tl880i2c.c.
