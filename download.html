<a name="0.2.3"></a><h3>MyHD 0.2.3</h3>
<b>Release notes:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many internal improvements in this version, 
	though few new user-worthy features.  Improvements to card
	initialization.  New ioctl interfaces.  Improved VPX chip support.
	More chip features documented.  See the ChangeLog for the full details.
	<br>All interrupt issues (IRQ sharing, etc.) should be resolved.

<b>Known issues:</b><br>

	It has no video capture capability.  Use this if you want to help

<a name="0.2.2"></a><h3>MyHD 0.2.2</h3>
<b>Release notes:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This release adds support for kernels through
	2.6.19, fixes interrupts, and adds a tool for testing ancillary drivers
	(such as the tuner and demodulator chips).
	Framebuffer image viewing is possible with the latest version of
	<a href="http://linux.bytesex.org/fbida/">fbi</a>, the framebuffer
	image viewer.  X and the Linux Console do not yet work with the
	framebuffer driver.  Video playback requires an as-yet unavailable
	patch to mplayer.  Video capture is not yet possible.

	<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TL880 card should not be sharing an interrupt line with the video
	card for best results.  It is best if the card has its own interrupt.  It may be
	necessary to move the card to a different PCI slot in your computer if
	your motherboard shares IRQ lines.  If you have no issues with shared
	IRQs, please let me know your hardware configuration and /proc/interrupts.

<a name="0.2.1"></a><h3>MyHD 0.2.1</h3>
<b>Release notes:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This version adds a preliminary framebuffer
	driver, allowing image and video playback (albeit at a very slow
	framerate).  Image viewing is possible with the latest version of
	<a href="http://linux.bytesex.org/fbida/">fbi</a>, the framebuffer
	image viewer.  X and the Linux Console do not yet work with the
	framebuffer driver.  Video playback requires an as-yet unavailable

</blockquote>
<br>
<b>Known issues:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This driver is for developers and testers.
	It has no video capture capability.  Use this if you want to help
	with driver development, or you want an overpriced color bars generator
	with an Open Source driver.  The color bars may or may not work on
	cards other than the MyHD.
	<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TL880 card must not be sharing an interrupt line with the video
	card.  It is best if the card has its own interrupt.  It may be
	necessary to move the card to a different PCI slot in your computer if
	your motherboard shares IRQ lines.
	<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupts do not work properly, at least with the MyHD.  Please
	do not run the tools/testdpcint.sh script or write to any registers that
	would enable interrupts.  The driver doesn't do anything with interrupts
	yet anyway, so this is not a big problem.

<a name="0.2.0"></a><h3>MyHD 0.2.0</h3>
<b>Release notes:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the official release of 0.2.0.
	Interrupt support has been disabled.  The 0.2.x series is the
	first series of the TL880 driver for kernel 2.6.  This release
	adds a lot of new information to the documentation on the TL880
	chip.  It also adds new tools for manipulating the card's memory
	and registers.  There is not yet any video capture support.

<b>Release notes:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second prerelase of version 0.2.0.
	This release adds minimal support for the on-screen display of images.
	So far only color test patterns are displayed behind the mouse cursor.

<b>Release notes:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	Changes and additions:
	<ul>
		<li>The ability to compile the driver with Visual Studio 2005 and the appropriate ddk.
		<li>The register watch tool can now rapid-fire capture a register to try to capture
		  every change made to the register (eventually to be expanded to decode I2C)
		<li>A DPC2 register dump option in the RegDumper tool.
		<li>Corrected file names and extensions of register and memory dumps.
		<li>Additional information in the report header.
		<li>The report window is bigger (how do I make it resizable???).
		<li>Memory/register dump loading no longer creates a file if the selection
		    doesn't exist.
		<li>A new DPC information tool.

<b>Release notes:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This release adds several new features.  There

<b>Release notes:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initial release of the <a href="tl880spy.html">TL880Spy</a> Windows
	tweak tool should be fully functional.  It is based on the BtSpy tool
	from the <a href="http://btwincap.sourceforge.net/">btwincap</a> Open
	Source Windows BT8xx capture driver.  This contains modified code from
	DScaler's PCI access driver and BtSpy itself.  See the README file in
	the distribution for information on how to use this program.
</blockquote>
<br>
<b>Known issues:</b><br>
<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard in this tool is mostly useless.  The
	real useful tools are available in the results page of the wizard.
	Currently there is not a way to read any random register; just a select
	few.  There is a tool to write any register, though.  Registers are not
	yet forced to multiples of four; only use multiples of four when looking
	for registers.
