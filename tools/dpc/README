Stuff associated with video output.  Running the dpcaux program will set the 
external sync to 1024x768p (can be changed in the source code - read the source
to find out how - note that the DPC clock probably needs to be reprogrammed for
any mode change; right now it's hard coded to one value in tl880init.c).

The videoout program will enable/disable external sync/video passthrough.  Zero
is passthrough enable/video disable, any other value is passthrough
disable/video enable.
