MyHD Linux Driver - Userspace Tools

To turn on color bars, first insmod the tl880 driver, then run

cd dpc; ./dpcaux 0 0 0; cd ..

The videoout program in the dpc directory switches video passthrough on/off.  So
far this only works for the MyHD.

The firmware is not required for simple color bars operation, but will be
required later on for anything MPEG related.  See the README file in the
firmware/ directory for more information and possible sources for firmware.

Description of tools:
regload
	Loads a dump of the TL880 register space from a file (must be 1048576
	bytes).  This will probably hard lock your system if the card has
	already been initialized.
	
regdump
	Dumps the entire 1MB register space to a file.  Note that most of the
	register space is either unused or redundant; hexdump can be used to
	filter out the redundant areas and produce an ascii file for human
	consumption.
	
readreg
	Reads the value of a register and prints it to stdout.  Parameter is in
	hexadecimal.  Uses mmap() and dereferences a pointer.  The mmap()
	interface will go away in the future in favor of an ioctl().
	
writereg
	Writes a value to a register.  Parameters are in hexadecimal.  Uses
	mmap() and dereferences a pointer.  The mmap() interface will go away in
	the future in favor of an ioctl().
	
setbits
	Command line interface to the set_bits() function.
	
write4reg
	Writes four registers at once; useful for writing parsed register dumps
	to the TL880 register space.
	
iocsetvip
	Sets the VIP state (0, 1, or 2).  I don't know what that means,
	exactly....  Does something to the GPIO regs (0x10194,0x10198).
	
iocreadreg
	Same thing as readreg but uses an ioctl() instead of mmap() and
	dereference.  The ioctl() interface will be preferred in the future.
	
iocwritereg
	Same thing as writereg but uses an ioctl() instead of mmap() and
	dereference.  The ioctl() interface will be preferred in the future.
	
randram
	Randomizes part of the TL880 memory (to see if anything happens).

striperam
	Sets part of the TL880 memory to alternating pattern.

cursor
	Uploads and displays a simple cursor on the TL880 screen.

rgb2ypbpr
	Converts an RGB[A] value to an AYPbPr value for use with registers
	10140-1017c (the cursor color palette).

testdpcint.sh
	Enables video output and activates DPC interrupts to test the DPC
	interrupt handler.  You need to compile all the other tools first to use
	this script.
