The firmware files included in this distribution are copied from /dev/zero
and will not work for any card.  They may even cause your system to hang if
you try to upload them.  You must extract a valid firmware from the card's
driver.  Firmware is not necessary for many card functions.  This program should
eventually be replaced with use of the request_firmware() kernel function when
kernels including that function become more widespread.

To extract the firmware from the MyHD 1.54 driver, download the 1.54 driver
.zip file (file number 23 date 2002-05-17) from:

http://www.mitinc.co.kr/mitinc/down/down_driver.jsp

Extract Mdp100.sys from the win9x directory in the archive, and place it in
this directory.

Verify that the file is 555064 bytes long, and run ./myhd_firmware_154.sh.

You can also use the Mdp100_2K.sys file from the 1.55.3.9e driver's w2000
directory.

Verify that the file is 438244 bytes, and run ./myhd_firmware_15539e.sh.

You can also use the Janus.sys file from the WinTV-HD update version 2.1.20114.

Verify that the file is 595144 bytes, and run ./wintvhd_firmware_2120114.sh

Once the firmware is extracted, simply use ./firmupload to upload.
